Indirect transmission is the monthly probability of being infected from the environment.

Direct transmission is the annual probability of being infected for either males or females. Relative male infection equals 1 if male and female infection rates are equal.  

S is the multiplier for direct transmission for individuals in infection classes 8:10 vs 1:7 (i.e., late stage infection versus early infection). 

Theta = 1 for frequency dependent transmission, 0 for density dependent transmission.  

An index of mortality of 0.43 equates to about a 2 year lifetime post-infection.  
Relative hunting risk is greater than 1 if infected individuals are more likely to be hunted than susceptible individuals.
