* Indirect transmission is the annual probability of being infected from the environment.  
* Direct R0 per year is the number of new infected cases an initial case would create in one year in a naive population.  
* Relative male infection equals 1 if male and female infection rates are equal,or greater than one if males are more likely than females to become infected.    
* Theta = 1 for frequency dependent transmission, 0 for density dependent transmission.  
* An index of mortality of 0.43 equates to about a 2 year lifetime post-infection.  
* Relative hunting risk is greater than 1 if infected individuals are more likely to be hunted than susceptible individuals.
